                -However, given only single refernce starting point, it is it hard to indetify what else to read.Thus, our goal was to create software that uses citation counts, paper relations etc. from Google Scholar's API to determine seminal papers of the field.

          <h2>Jovan Petrovic</h2>
          <p>
            He walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings.
            He had always hated noisy Planet-X with its ordinary, outrageous oceans.
            It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel irritable.

          <h2>Kate Smith</h2>
          <p>
            Jovan gulped. He glanced at his own reflection.
            He was a sympathetic, controlling, beer drinker with pink spots and solid legs.
            His friends saw him as a vain, valid vicar. Once, he had even helped a fried puppy recover from a flying accident.

          <h2>Anna Mcneal</h2>
          <p>
            But not even a sympathetic person who had once helped a fried puppy recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what Kate had in store today.
