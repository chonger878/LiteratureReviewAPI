                  <h2>Jovan Petrovic</h2>
                  <p>
                    He walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. 
                    He had always hated noisy Planet-X with its ordinary, outrageous oceans.
                    It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel irritable.

                  <h2>Kate Smith</h2>
                  <p>
                    Jovan gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. 
                    He was a sympathetic, controlling, beer drinker with pink spots and solid legs. 
                    His friends saw him as a vain, valid vicar. Once, he had even helped a fried puppy recover from a flying accident.

                  <h2>Anna Mcneal</h2>
                  <p>
                    But not even a sympathetic person who had once helped a fried puppy recover from a flying accident, was prepared for what Kate had in store today.
